-  Framework  
  The two flow charts demonstrate the stages and equipment used for cement production, and how cement is further processed into concrete.

  First, a crusher with two titled surfaces receives limestone and clay combining and crushing the raw materials into powder for further processing. The powder then enters a mixer to achieve a higher level of homogeneity. After that, the mixture goes via a pipe into a large cylindrical rotating heater (with an external heat source) and is melted. The melted mixture drops down from thr heater onto a conveyor belt before being sent for grinding into cement. Finally, loose cement is packed into bags.

**step 3**
-  Phase 2  
  In the second phase, cement is then used for the production of concrete, and the first step is to create a mixture: 15% of cement is poured out from the bags, 10% of water from a pipe, 25% sand and 50% of gravel (small tones) are shoveled. The ingredients are then all sent into a gigantic cylindrical rotating mixer. Once the mixture is adequately stirred, it forms concrete which can be used for construction purposes.
