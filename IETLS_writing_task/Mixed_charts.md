**step 1 : Summary**
- What's the framework ?  
  
  The two bar charts demonstrate the career choices (excluding full-time work) of graduate students and postgraduate students in the UK in 2008. The choices include part-time work, voluntary work, further study, and unemployment.

**step 2 : Diff & Comm in Quantities (Within data groups & Between data groups)**  

- Chart 1 key features  
   Among approximately 67,000 graduates, a few percent less than half chose to pursue further study, accounting for the largest proportion. In the meantime, part-time work and unemployment both took around a quarter of total. In contrast, voluntary work was the least popular option, occupying a mere 5%.  

- Chart 2 key features
  Postgraduates followed a pattern with some similarity to graduates in 2008, though in a much smaller scale. Among approximately 7,000 of them,
  further study was again the most popular option, which accounted for around 30% of the total; unlike graduates, significantly more postgraduates chose part-time work than unemployment, standing at 2,535 and 1,625 respectively. Voluntary work was also again the least favorable choice at about 5%.

**step 3 Conclusion**
- Connection between charts  
  In conclusion, the non-fulltime job preferences of graduates and postgraduates in the UK were in totally different scales, but shared some similar features.
